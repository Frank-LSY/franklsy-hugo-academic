My undergraduate study in computer science and technology major of Central China Normal University (2015-2019). I have exchanged and studied at UC San Diego for one semester from March 2018 to June 2018. I have worked as an intern in the Computational Biology and Computational Chemistry Laboratory of the University of Science and Technology of China from July 2018 to December 2018. I received the master's degree in Biomedical Informatics from the University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine. Under the supervision of Dr. Xinghua Lu, my works mainly focus on medical data analysis and text mining. I'm currently working in CETC, mainly engaged in front-end software development, data mining, data analysis and web design.

本人本科就读于华中师范大学计算机科学与技术专业（2015-2019）。曾于2018.3-2018.6在UC San Diego交流学习一学期。并在2018.7-2018.12在中国科学技术大学计算生物与计算化学实验室实习。硕士就读于匹兹堡大学医学院生物医学信息学专业(2019-2021)，师从 Dr.Xinghua Lu。主要从事医疗数据及文本挖掘工作。目前工作于CETC(中国电科)，主要从事前端软件开发，数据挖掘分析，网页设计等工作。
