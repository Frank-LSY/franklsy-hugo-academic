I graduated from the University of Pittsburgh, Department of Biomedical Informatics with an M.S. degree in 2021. During my master's period, I did research under the supervision of Prof. Xinghua Lu, with the main focus on medical data analysis and text mining with interpretable machine learning and deep learning method. Besides, I also learned experience of basic big data skills, web-app design and development, and constructing machine learning models from zero.

I've got about 2 years of experience working at CETC as a software development engineer. I engaged in web-app design and development, data analysis, and data mining.

Currently, I'm working at the Department of Public Health, Medical School, Zhejiang University as a research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Xifeng Wu(吴息凤) and Wenyuan Li(李文渊). Our big goal is to build an AI-based system for helping physicians monitor and manage chronic diseases, especially visceral cancers. I'm now working on applying modern and popular machine learning and deep learning method in abdominal adipose tissue segmentation and detection.

I'm now looking for a Ph.D. position. My interests lie in applying data mining and AI in healthcare and medical research, or anything related to that.

<!-- There are indeed some fancy ideas in my mind, like:
  - For most chronic diseases, the start point of causes is often tiny and it's not easy for us to feel, however, I believe the causes are mostly buried in those patients' medical records, include those  . -->

我于2021年毕业于匹兹堡大学生物医学信息学系，获得硕士学位。在硕士期间，我有幸在Prof. Xinghua Lu 的指导下进行研究，主要方向是用可解释的机器学习和深度学习方法进行医学数据分析和文本挖掘。此外，在匹兹堡大学和卡耐基梅隆大学，我还学习了基本的大数据技能、网络应用程序设计和开发。同时我还有从零开始构建机器学习和简单深度学习强化学习模型的经验。

我在中国电科38所有大约2年的工作经验，担任软件开发工程师。主要从事网络应用程序设计和开发，数据分析和数据挖掘。

目前，我在浙江大学医学院公共卫生系担任研究助理，在吴息凤和李文渊教授的指导下工作。我们的目标是建立一个基于人工智能的辅助诊断系统，帮助医生监测和管理慢性疾病，特别是内脏方面的癌症。我现在正着手利用主流的机器学习和深度学习方法用于腹部脂肪组织的分割和检测。

我现在正在寻找一个博士就读机会。我的主要研究兴趣在于将数据挖掘和人工智能应用于医疗保健和医学研究，或一些与此相关的课题方向。
